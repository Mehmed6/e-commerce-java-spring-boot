# e-Commerce Application with Spring Boot

This project is an e-commerce platform developed with Java Spring Boot. It provides a system where users can securely register, log in, and use JWT-based authentication and authorization mechanisms. Once logged in, users can perform actions with a JWT token. If the token expires, a new token can be obtained using a refresh token. Only admin users can perform CRUD operations on categories and products.

The project enhances user experience by using Thymeleaf for HTML-based frontend and JSON for API-based backend communication. Users can save multiple addresses and cards, add products to their cart, and place orders. Payment processing is done via Iyzico integration.

The project leverages tools like MapStruct and Lombok to simplify coding and increase productivity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è JWT Token Usage


All JSON-based operations require the use of **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. After successfully logging in, users must include their JWT token in the `Authorization` header of every API request. If the token expires, a new JWT token can be obtained using the **Refresh Token**.

Example:

* `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN_HERE>`
